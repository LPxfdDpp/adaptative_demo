# Adaptative Demo

This is a sample Flutter application that applies several tips presented during my presentation at the [FlutterVikings](https://fluttervikings.com/) conference.

All the slides are [available here](https://www.figma.com/proto/fkmIvbJxvjPyxrsNS4U3tK/Flutter-Conferences?node-id=1%3A2&viewport=-201%2C-90%2C0.07628733664751053&scaling=scale-down) .

Still a work in progress, several things are missing :

* Semantics support
* Kerboard / Mouse support
* Offline mode
