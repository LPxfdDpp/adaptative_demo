# Adaptative Demo

This is a sample Flutter application that applies several tips presented during my presentation at the [FlutterVikings](https://fluttervikings.com/) conference.

Still a work in progress, several things are still missing :

* Semantics support
* Kerboard / Mouse support
* Offline mode
